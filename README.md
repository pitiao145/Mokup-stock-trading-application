# Mokup-stock-trading-application
This is a fictive example of a stock trading application, using an API to get real-time stock quotes.

This web application was created with python, HTML, CSS, JS, using a flask framework. I used an SQLite database.
The web application fetches the live stock quotes through the Yahoo finance API.

  -  Profile sections where a user can change his password.
  -  Asking for stock quotes.
  -  Buying and selling stocks.
  -  History of all the transactions.
  -  Overview of the current holdings in the user's wallet, with comprehensive charts.
